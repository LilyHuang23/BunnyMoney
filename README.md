# Bunny Money

This is a 2D Platform game that uses the Arcade library in Python. I follow tutorials and get to practice my coding knowledge by using Python. I have always hoped that I can make a game in one day so I take this as my first stepstone. In this project, I was able to learn how to create a TileMap and implement Arcade.
